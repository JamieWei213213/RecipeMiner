# Nutritional Intelligence from Recipes

This project extracts and analyzes nutrition data from two primary sources: the **FatSecret API** and **DiabetesFoodHub.org**. It builds a unified, structured dataset of 2,000+ food items and recipes to support macronutrient analysis, diet comparison, and health-focused data applications.

# Data Mining and Scraping

## Features

### FatSecret API Integration
- Authenticates via OAuth 2.0 (client credentials flow)
- Searches foods (e.g., `"apple"`) and paginates results
- Extracts:  
  - Food name  
  - Brand name  
  - Nutritional description  
  - Macronutrients (calories, fat, protein, carbs)  
  - Food type and URL  
- Saves to `foods_data.csv`

### Web Scraping: DiabetesFoodHub
- Scrapes recipe data from 12+ dietary categories (e.g., low-carb, vegetarian, dessert)
- Collects recipe links across all pages in each category
- Extracts embedded JSON-LD nutrition info
- Compiles results in `diabetes_recipes.csv`

### Additional Diet Datasets
Includes cleaned nutrition data from curated datasets for:
- Keto
- Paleo
- Dash
- Mediterranean
- Vegan
- Vegetarian
- Trend diets

Each file (e.g. `keto.csv`) contains:
- Recipe name, cuisine type
- Protein, Carbs, Fat (g)
- Extraction metadata (date/time)

## Technologies Used
- **Python**
- `requests`, `BeautifulSoup`, `pandas`, `json`, `time`, `random`
- **OAuth 2.0** via `requests_oauthlib`
- HTML scraping with `BeautifulSoup`
- FatSecret API: [https://platform.fatsecret.com/](https://platform.fatsecret.com/)
- Targeted scraping: [https://diabetesfoodhub.org](https://diabetesfoodhub.org)

## Output Files
| File Name            | Description                                 |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| `foods_data.csv`     | FatSecret API results                       |
| `diabetes_recipes.csv` | Scraped recipe + nutrition data          |
| `keto.csv`, `paleo.csv`, etc. | Structured datasets by diet       |

---

## Example Use Cases
- Compare macro breakdowns between diets (e.g. keto vs paleo)
- Identify high-protein, low-carb meals for diabetics
- Build dashboards or ML pipelines for dietary recommendations

# Nutrition Analysis & Macro Insights

This module analyzes macronutrient distributions and ingredient patterns across recipe datasets from various diets (e.g., keto, vegan, dash, paleo, diabetes, Mediterranean). It extracts, cleans, and visualizes nutrition data to uncover trends in food composition.

#### Key Features:
- **Macro Ratio Calculation**  
  Computes `fat_ratio`, `carb_ratio`, and `protein_ratio` for each recipe by normalizing macronutrient totals. Helps identify which diets are fat-, carb-, or protein-dominant.

- **Ingredient Text Analysis**  
  - Extracts structured ingredient terms from unstructured text  
  - Cleans and counts ingredient occurrences  
  - Plots the **Top 30 Most Common Ingredient Words** (e.g., garlic, pepper, yogurt)

- **Cuisine-Level Macro Comparison**  
  - Aggregates mean macro ratios by cuisine (e.g., American, Italian, Mediterranean)  
  - Visualizes how cuisines differ in macronutrient composition

- **Diet-Level Macro Distribution**  
  - Boxplots show macro ratio variation across diet types  
  - Summary statistics (mean, std, median) highlight how balanced or skewed each diet is

- **Correlation Analysis**  
  - Encodes diet types and computes Pearson correlations  
  - Reveals how fat, carb, and protein values relate to specific diets like vegan or keto
